**Our Approach**
<br>
In approaching this project we began by talking to the Admissions Manager to understand the purpose of the app and the desired functionality.  We then discussed what needed to be done and divided up the work.  For the most part we worked independently checking in often to see how everyone was doing and working out issues as needed.  For Github we created a project repo which each member of the group forked.  Each member then worked in their own branch on their computer then pulled to the project repo when a feature was ready.
